\underline{Outline}:  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project is a chore scheduling program for roommates, especially college roommates. This will help to fairly distribute chores among dorm roommates, and maintain a healthy and safe environment for everybody. There is currently no program specifically designed for this, if you use a traditional scheduling program or task manager, keeping the assignment of chores up-to-date can become a chore. This program sets out to fix this issue, by randomly assigning an even amount of chores to all roommates on a user-defined set schedule. The benefits of a system such as this are that it's easier to keep up with chores, as everyone knows what they need to do, and it reduces tension between roommates over who does what chore. Additionally, it'll lessen the chance of someone in the dorm getting sick, as it'll be much easier to keep the dorm clean because everyone knows what their chore is. We're planning on providing many ways of reminding roommates of what their chore is, and when they're recommended to do the chore. Hopefully, by providing reminders such as text messages, push notifications, emails and calendar events, we'll make sure that roommates will not fall behind on their chores, reducing possible areas of tension between roommates.  
  
\underline{Existing competitors}:  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, SmartDay, Apple Calendar, WhenToWork, Google Tasks, Microsoft To-Do, Remember The Milk, Any.do, Trello.  
  
\underline{Problems with existing competitors}:  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For most of these apps, such as the calendar or task apps, maintaining the schedule can be difficult, and it's easy to fall behind in maintaining that schedule. This application will let you import your schedule, and assign chores based around this schedule. There are other competitors such as WhenToWork, which provide a similar service, however, these are business focused and can be difficult to handle for busy college students. Our product provides a unique service to busy roommates, currently unmet by other businesses. Ultimately, this is an untapped market and we're in a position to provide a unique service that will benefit many people besides just college students.  
  
\underline{Focuses}:  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are planning on focusing primarily on Area 1 &mdash; HTML, CSS, and graphics, and secondarily on Area 3 &mdash; Pulling static data from a database file (such as JSON or XML). Hopefully, we will be able to implement Areas 2, 4, and 5 effectively for the final product, however, we want to focus on making an effecive proof-of-concept. Our goal is to make a working application for use by RPI students by the end of the semester.
